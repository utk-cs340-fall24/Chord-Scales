# Files you worked on
I was unsure on whether you wanted ALL files or just files we created ourselves so I included all but the files I mainly coded and changed were: App.css, App.js, Freboard.js, and util.js
- Chord-Scales/project_files/frontend/src/App.js
- Chord-Scales/project_files/frontend/src/Login.js

# What you accomplished
I created a login and sign up buttons
I created a requirement of signing up to log in
I created accounts to go with the login
I created a form reset to forget past login
I made sure user caches save and delete when needed
I created username display to show logged in
I made sure the sign up button disapears when logged in
