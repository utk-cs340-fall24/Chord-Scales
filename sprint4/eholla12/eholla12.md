Chord-Scales

## What I planned to do:
* Planned to begin linking front end and back end
* Planned to partition the mass of relevant notes generated into scales

## What I did not do:
* Did not completely finish linking front end and back end, it will be done before presentation though

## Problems I encountered:
* It was difficult to figure out the logic for the partitioning of notes into playable scales
* It was difficult finding the time to meet up with groupmates as other classes were quite time consuming

## Issues I worked on: 
* Worked on issue #4: [Fretboard Logic](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Chord-Scales/issues/4) and issue #6: [Linking Frontend and Backend](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Chord-Scales/issues/6) and issue #17: [Display individual chords/scales on fretboard
](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Chord-Scales/issues/17)

## Files worked on: 
* project_files/scale-generation.cpp

## What I accomplished:
* I completed the scale generation
