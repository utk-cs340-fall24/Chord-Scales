## Sprint 4 ##
Name: Lorenzo Bailey, github id: lbaile33, groupname: Chordscales

# What you planned to do #
- Range feature | issue number: #35 | issue link: https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Chord-Scales/issues/35
- Linking frontend backend | issue number: #6 | https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Chord-Scales/issues/6


# What did you not do
- Linking frontend and backend didn't finish flushly and we had some trouble getting the original code to play nice with each other

# What problems you encountered
- linking frontend and backend ended up being a bigger task than making the project in the first place, due to trouble communicating between the react app and the c++ code this caused us to try sockets, api's, and other methods to link the two

# Issues you worked on
- Issue #35 of adding the range of notes for the fretboard
- Issue #6 of linking frontend and backend

# Files you worked on
- Chord-Scales/project_files/frontend/src/App.js
- Chord-Scales/project_files/frontend/src/Fretboard.js
- Chord-Scales/project_files/frontend/src/Utils.js

# What you accomplished
- Some ui tweaks such as button design and colors
- Creating a range feature that allows the user to select a range of notes to display
