### What you planned to do

* keep working on the sounds effects
* find errors in the app

### What you did not do

* Connect playnote to the react app

### What problems you encountered

* I couldn't find a way to extended the sound for each note to more than the lengh of the .wav files so the length of each notes are fixed to around half a second.

### Issues you worked on

* keep working on the code for playing the note(https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Chord-Scales/issues/8) Play notes
* Get the .wav files for all the notes(https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Chord-Scales/issues/7) notes .wav files 

### Files you worked on

### What you accomplished
