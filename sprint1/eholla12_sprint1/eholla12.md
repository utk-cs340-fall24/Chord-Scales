Chord-Scales

## What I planned to do:
* Planned to figure out back-end chord and scale generation logic
* Account for more complicated chords and scales (extended chords, scale modes, etc.)
* Link the front end and back end so that any chord/scale generated by my code could be visualized

## What I did not do:
* Did not succeed in linking the front end and back end yet
* There are still some cases of more niche chords/scales that it cannot account for yet

## Problems I encountered:
* It got a bit confusing managing all the different cases for chords/scales as in most cases there are minor changes between each chord/scale type so while there isn't a ton of code it was a bit tricky at times to get it all working for all cases.
* Not entirely sure yet how to go about linking the backend to Lorenzo's code

## Issues I worked on:
* Worked on issue #4: [Fretboard Logic](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Chord-Scales/issues/4) and issue #6: [Linking Frontend and Backend](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Chord-Scales/issues/6)

## Files worked on: 
* project_files/scale-generation.cpp

## What I accomplished: 
* Succeeded in writing the code for Scale and Chord generation
* The code accounts for extended chords (7th, 9th, 11th, 13th), scale modes (Ionian(Major), Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, Mixolydian, Aeolian(Minor), Locrian(Diminished))
* For each chord/scale we are able to access every fret necessary in forming them, this will be useful in linking them
