# What did you not do
- Graphic design for fretboard, im not sure if i am satisfied with the current setup design but didn't find time to change it this sprint
- Webpage setup, I ran into issues creating a webpage due to the settings on the repo but after talking to the TA at sprint 1 we have fixed that and I should be able to have a website next sprint.
- Linking the frontend to backend implimentation never happened due to timing so hopefully we can connect them and get everything linked together.

# What problems you encountered
- Webpage setup was not finished due to repo permissions but that has been fixed now
- Alot of time went into learning music and the new languages with css and html but they are not too complicated.

# Issues you worked on
I wont link them for sake of time but they are linked above in what you planned to do
- Issue #1 of creating a basic app homepage
- Issue #9 of making the screen size adjustable
- Issue #10 of creating the dropdown and interactable buttons on the homepage
- Issue #11 of adding a interactive fretboard with onHover and onClick functionality
- Issue #12 of adding new fretboard shapes

# What you accomplished
I took my inital webpage from helloplus and built onto it. 
I added interactive functionality with dropdown menus, onHover/onClick and adjustable screen size. 
I aswell worked towards creating a sleeker design for the webpage as my inital one was just a white screen outputting the bear minimum while the new sprint one homepage is much nicer design. 
I aswell created javascript logic for all the combinations of root note, scale and shape to output the fretboard which can be either be implimented along side the backend c++ logic or translated to c++ when frontend and backend get linked together.
