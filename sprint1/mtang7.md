# Sprint 1

Name: Mingxuan Tang, GitHub id: CozyRainningInn, Group Name: Chord-Scales

### What you planned to do

* play note implementation
* Get the .wav files for all the notes through online software

### What you did not do

* Get all the .wav files for all the notes (only have two notes working right now)

### What problems you encountered

* It was hard to find a usable audio library since I had a lot of trouble linking all the dll files within the working folder
* I couldn't find an online database that has .wav files recording of all the guitar notes, so I had to instead find an online
  software that allows you to generate guitar notes and export them as a .wav file.

### Issues you worked on

[#1] Implement part of the code for playing the notes(https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Chord-Scales/issues/8) Play notes
[#2] Get the .wav files for all the notes(https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Chord-Scales/issues/7) notes .wav files 

### Files you worked on

* C:Chord-Scales/project_files/play_notes.cpp

### What you accomplished

* I've finished part of the code for the play notes to work 
* Found an online software that can generate and export .wav files for the notes of a guitar.
