# Sprint 1
Evan Newport, evannewport, Chord-Scales

### What I planned to do
- Enhance what my group already had when I joined.
- Make meaningful visual changes.
- Add something new to the project.

### What I did not do
- Add anything solely new, just built on top of what they had.

### Problems I encountered
- Joined group 3 days before Sprint 1 was due, a last minute but very necessary move. Without making this whole assignment about how I changed groups, I wasn't able to meet them until the day Sprint 1 was due, and they had most of the work for this Sprint complete, but not on GitHub. So I wasn't able to get a good idea on what the project was or have anything to go off until today when we discussed it and the React App was added to the GitHub.

### Issue Tickets I worked on
- [#14](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Chord-Scales/issues/14) - Graphic for logo

### Files I worked on
- project_files/frontend/src/App.css
- project_files/frontend/src/Fretboard.js

### What I accomplished
- Adjusted fretboard logic
- Gave frontend a more attractive color pallette 
- Added fade/hover effects
- Added gradient background
- Improved styling for buttons
- Added logo
