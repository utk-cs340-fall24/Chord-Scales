# Sprint 2
Evan Newport, evannewport, Chord-Scales

### What I planned to do
- Add a big new feature to the react app
- Make clicking on notes play the corresponding guitar sounds
- Allow option to play full chord 

### What I did not do
- Make note playing work perfectly, Fret 12 doesn't work and I don't have time to fix today (fret 0-11 do though).
- Add option to play full chords

### Problems I encountered
- Fret 12 doesn't play it's 6 notes, and I couldn't finish fixing.
- Metronome initially had very abrasive high-pitched twang, did end up fixing.
