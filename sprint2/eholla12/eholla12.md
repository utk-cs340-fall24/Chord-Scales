# Sprint 2

Chord-Scales

## What I planned to do:
* Planned to account for some more cases such as blues scales and suspended chords
* Planned to begin linking front end and back end
* Planned to partition the mass of notes within the scales and chords we produce into individual playable chords and scales

## What I did not do:
* Did not completely finish linking front end and back end but I think will soon
* I was not able to account for individual scales, but I did get the chords done

## Problems I encountered:
* This sprint was much more complicated for me than I anticipated
* The code behind partitioning the mass of relevant notes into relevant and playable chords was quite complicated
* I went through several iterations but only submitted the commits for the final one, if I need more code please notify me as I could try to figure out how to access the code from older commits as there was much more than I did but had to overhaul

## Issues I worked on: 
* Worked on issue #4: [Fretboard Logic](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Chord-Scales/issues/4) and issue #6: [Linking Frontend and Backend](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Chord-Scales/issues/6) and issue #17: [Display individual chords/scales on fretboard
](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Chord-Scales/issues/17)

## Files worked on: 
* project_files/scale-generation.cpp

## What I accomplished:
* I accomplished the inclusion of suspended chords and blues scales
* I succeeded in partitioning relevant notes into many variations of playable chords, and built the foundation for the individual scale generation
