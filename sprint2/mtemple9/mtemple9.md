## Sprint 2 ##
Name: Matt Templeton, github id: turtlev, groupname: Chordscales

# What you planned to do #
- User authentication | issue number: #3 | issue link: https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Chord-Scales/issues/3
- Make User accounts | issue number: #2 | issue link: https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Chord-Scales/issues/2


# What did you not do
- Did not fully finish making accounts with google. You can login and have an "account" but no memory is kept.
- Nothing was linked from my logins to the main front/back end. This can be done next sprint.

# What problems you encountered
- I struggled so much with google Auth. I went down a rabbit hole writing strenious nonsense to try and make my own authenticator. Then I asked about porting googles open auth, and did that. This worries me because replacing my old nonsense that did not work makes it look like I barely contributed to the group.
- also encountered problems setting up API and remembering accounts. welcome back message coming soon.

# Issues you worked on
- Issue #3 of user Authentication
- Issue #2 making user accounts
- Issue #5 of webpage setup kinda. We will be porting my login to the site.

# Files you worked on
I worked to make the login authenticator this sprint:
- Chord-Scales/project_files/auth/src/App.css 
- Chord-Scales/project_files/auth/src/App.tsx
- Chord-Scales/project_files/auth/src/index.css


# What you accomplished
I setup google auth with a login and logout.
This kind of mimics an account.
I made the web page visually appealing with gradient background and fading messages.
