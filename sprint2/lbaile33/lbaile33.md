## Sprint 2 ##
Name: Lorenzo Bailey, github id: lbaile33, groupname: Chordscales

# What you planned to do #
- Playlist for chords/scales | issue number: #16 | issue link: https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Chord-Scales/issues/16
- Interactive fretboard | issue number: #11 | issue link: https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Chord-Scales/issues/11
- Webpage setup | issue number: #5 | issue link: https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Chord-Scales/issues/5


# What did you not do
- Playing notes onClick, I implimented onClick functionality but didn't finish actually playing the note.
- Linking frontend and backend didn't happen this sprint but hopefully sprint 3 we can link the two together such as notes playing and the fretboard highlighting being linked to the other programs

# What problems you encountered
- Webpage was much harder to setup than I initially figured it would be, struggled with setup phase of github pages for website
- Playlist graphic design, struggled with finding a nice look, will focus on finding a nice look in future sprints

# Issues you worked on
- Issue #16 of adding a playlist of scales/chords
- Issue #11 finishing the adding of a interactive fretboard with onHover and onClick functionality
- Issue #5 of webpage setup

# Files you worked on
I mainly worked on setting up the website end rather than code this sprint but the code I did work on was within these:
- Chord-Scales/project_files/frontend/src/App.css 
- Chord-Scales/project_files/frontend/src/App.js
- Chord-Scales/project_files/frontend/src/Fretboard.js


# What you accomplished
I setup the webpage using github pages, ran into struggles getting the repo able to be used on github pages but eventually got it up and running on https://utk-cs340-fall24.github.io/Chord-Scales/
I added a playlist feature for scales/chords to save your old patterns/visualization.
I added a test version of the onClick sound feature which plays a test sound when clicking a note and will play the note in the future.
