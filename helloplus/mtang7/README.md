This is a simple Python program that uses pygame which is a game creation library to plays out the sounds of the note entered by the user. 
After pip installing pygame the file can run by simply using the command: Python note_sound.py
This might be incorporated into our Chord Scales project's web app that allows the chords and scales to be played out to the user.
