# Google sign in practice
The purpose of this program is just to familiarize myself more with both some frontend work and the process of using google sign in on web apps.

## User instructions
In order to use this program you will have to go through the setup on this page: [Google sign in setup](https://developers.google.com/identity/sign-in/web/sign-in)
You do have to have a public URL, so you cannot be using a private server, at least to my knowledge as I could not get it to work that way but I'm also not an expert.
Once you setup on the google page just open the main.html file provided and on line 21 replace the content="179842762256-iql2t6f2j4muretmadvb2hjc0ullt641.apps.googleusercontent.com", with your own copied key from the setup website.
Upon doing this you should have access to sign in and once you do you will be greeted.

## Use in our group project
This may be relevant to our group project as we discussed integrating some sort of account feature so that users may save the chords and scales they create and return to them later. It was helpful to see how we may begin to integrate features like that into our project and see how you handle user data after authorization. I'm definitely not an expert on it but I think this has helped me to gain some understanding that I may apply to the full project.
