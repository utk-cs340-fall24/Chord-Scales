# Sprint 3

Chord-Scales

## What I planned to do:
* Planned to begin linking front end and back end
* Planned to partition the mass of relevant notes generated into individual chords and schales

## What I did not do:
* Did not completely finish linking front end and back end but I think will soon
* I have not figured out the generation of individual scales yet, but I have started

## Problems I encountered:
* It is quite difficult to partition a bunch of notes into chords and scales as there aren't really universal rules to apply
* I believe I must overhaul the logic I do have for scale generation
* I had to freuently overhaul my chord generation function, as it was not generating correct chords, if I am lacking on code commits, I can attempt to find the ones I have overhauled. Please notify me if this is the case.

## Issues I worked on: 
* Worked on issue #4: [Fretboard Logic](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Chord-Scales/issues/4) and issue #6: [Linking Frontend and Backend](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Chord-Scales/issues/6) and issue #17: [Display individual chords/scales on fretboard
](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Chord-Scales/issues/17)

## Files worked on: 
* project_files/scale-generation.cpp

## What I accomplished:
* I highly refined the chord generation from last sprint, as it was kind of working before but now it produces more playable chords and accounts for any repeats generated.
* I layed the groundwork for the scale generation, however after looking at it a bit I realize I may need to change my approach
