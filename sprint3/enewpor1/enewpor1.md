# Sprint 3
Evan Newport, evannewport, Chord-Scales

### What I planned to do
- Implement beat accent functionality into metronome
- Add time signature functionality to metronome
- Allow user to see detailed information about the selected chord/scale, such as its theory/common usages

### What I did not do
- Accomplished all I needed to this sprint

### Problems I encountered
- Detailed info was going to be a sidebar, however it was covering the fretboard, had to nestle it into a button
- Beat accent sounded inconsistent with normal metronome sound, was able to fix

### Issue tickets I worked on
- [#27](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Chord-Scales/issues/27) - Add time signature to metronome
- [#28](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Chord-Scales/issues/28) - Add beat accent to metronome
- [#29](https://github.com/utk-cs340-fall24/Chord-Scales/issues/29) - Add sidebar with detailed information about current chord/scale

### Files I worked on
- project_files/frontend/src/Metronome.js
- project_files/frontend/src/ScaleInfoSidebar.js
- project_files/frontend/src/App.css
- project_files/frontend/src/App.js

### What I accomplished
- Fully fleshed out metronome & moved it to upper right corner to give Playlist feature room
- Added time signature functionality to metronome
- Added ability for user to select accent beats within Metronome for better playing experience
- Added dynamic button that gives information about current chord/scale including its common uses, mood, theory
